Specifically, it uses a hidden folder named `.cache`. The typical path looks like this:\n","\n","- On Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS):\n","  ```\n","  ~/.cache/huggingface/\n","  ```\n","\n","- On Windows systems:\n","  ```\n","  C:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\.cache\\huggingface\\\n","  ```\n","\n","**NOTE - .cache is hidden by default!

This cache system is designed to be shared across various libraries that depend on the Hugging Face Hub. Here is a detailed explanation of where and how these models are stored:\n","\n","## Cache Directory Structure\n","\n","The cache directory is typically located in the user's home directory, but it can be customized using the `cache_dir` argument in methods or by setting the `HF_HOME` or `HF_HUB_CACHE` environment variables. The structure of the cache directory is as follows:\n","\n","```\n","<CACHE_DIR>\n","├─ <MODELS>\n","├─ <DATASETS>\n","├─ <SPACES>\n","```\n","\n","Within these main folders, the cache is further organized by repository type, namespace (if applicable), and repository name. For example:\n","\n","```\n","<CACHE_DIR>\n","├─ models--julien-c--EsperBERTo-small\n","├─ models--lysandrejik--arxiv-nlp\n","├─ models--bert-base-cased\n","├─ datasets--glue\n","├─ datasets--huggingface--DataMeasurementsFiles\n","├─ spaces--dalle-mini--dalle-mini\n","```\n","\n","## Detailed Folder Structure\n","\n","Each repository folder contains subfolders that store different types of files, such as references, blobs, and snapshots. Here is an example of the folder structure for a dataset:\n","\n","```\n","<CACHE_DIR>\n","├─ datasets--glue\n","│   ├─ refs\n","│   ├─ blobs\n","│   ├─ snapshots\n","```\n","\n","## Managing the Cache\n","\n","### Scanning the Cache\n","\n","To manage and inspect the cache, you can use the `huggingface-cli` tool or the `scan_cache_dir` function from the `huggingface_hub` library. This allows you to see which repositories and revisions are taking up disk space. For example:\n","\n","```python\n","from huggingface_hub import scan_cache_dir\n","\n","hf_cache_info = scan_cache_dir()\n","print(hf_cache_info)\n","```\n","\n","This will return an `HFCacheInfo` object containing details about the cached repositories, their sizes, and any warnings about corrupted caches.\n","\n","### Example Command\n","\n","Using the `huggingface-cli` to scan the cache:\n","\n","```bash\n","huggingface-cli scan-cache\n","```\n","\n","This command will output a detailed report of the cache, including repository IDs, types, sizes, and paths.\n","\n","## Customizing the Cache Directory\n","\n","You can customize the cache directory by setting the `cache_dir` argument in methods or by using environment variables. For example:\n","\n","```python\n","from huggingface_hub import cached_assets_path\n","\n","path = cached_assets_path(library_name=\"datasets\", namespace=\"SQuAD\", subfolder=\"download\")\n","print(path)\n","```\n","\n","This will return the path to the cached assets for the specified library, namespace, and subfolder.\n","\n","## Conclusion\n","\n","The Hugging Face cache system is designed to efficiently store and manage models, datasets, and other resources. By understanding the structure and management tools available, users can effectively control their cache usage and ensure optimal performance.\n","\n","For more detailed information, you can refer to the Hugging Face documentation on managing the cache system[1][3][5][7].\n","\n","Citations:\n","[1] https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/manage-cache\n","[2]
